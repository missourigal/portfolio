                My name is Scherry and I am a UX/UI designer from Philadelphia enrolled in <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful's software engineering bootcamp</a> to better understand what it takes to build the things that I design. I feel like this will help make me a better designer and help me produce designs faster in an agile world. This portfolio will showcase the work I produce on this new engineering journey. Welcome, and thank you for viewing my work. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:scherry.sweeney@gmail.com">reach out with any feedback</a>.

                I've been a UX/UI designer for the last 12 years, and before that, I held many various titles (like web designer, webmaster, content strategist, information architect) that equated to being the main person on marketing teams who could produce the words, the design and graphics, and even a little bit of frontend code for corporate websites. When I made the switch to being a UI engineer for a SaaS product and started asking, "But why are we building this feature? What is it the user is trying accomplish?" I solidified my path as a user experience designer. 
                <p>Now, I want to learn and be able to participate in the coding of my designs, so I can help our frontend developers both from designing the right thing in the first place perspective, but also to help the team out from a resources perspective, as well.</p>
                <p>Away from work, I like to stay as far away from the computer as possible and get outside for hikes, gardening or eating/drinking with friends. </p>
                <p>
                    A few of my favorite things are: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Traveling (an meeeting new people!)</li>
                        <li>Horseback riding</li>
                        <li>Reading a good mystery on a rainy day</li>
                        <li>Watching movies (the more explosions the better!)</li>
                    </ul>
